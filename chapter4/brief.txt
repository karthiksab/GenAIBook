In the earlier chapters, we understood computer vision techniques, representation learning, and variational auto encoder. This chapter gives an introduction to generative modeling methods. We will understand encoder-decoder architecture, various generative adversarial network types, learn diffusion processes and different diffusion models . Throughout the chapter, we will brief out generative modeling techniques, neural architectures for mathematical briefing, and examples. The examples we have chosen are improving image resolution using SR-GAN, Text to Image conversion using Multi-Modal architecture, and Image generation using Diffusion process.
